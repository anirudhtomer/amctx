\section{Introduction}
\label{sec : introduction}
According to the inclusion criteria of the study, a total of 239 kidney transplant patients were included in the data set. The transplantation characteristics of these patients is presented in Table \ref{tab : baseline_characteristics}. The data set also includes periodical measurements of serum creatinine (SCr) and protein creatinine ratio (PCR), which are biomarkers used to check the state of the transplant. The median number of repeated SCr and PCR measurements per patient are 45 and 37, respectively. For SCr 95\% of the observations are taken before 6 years, while for PCR they are taken before 5.4 years. The median time between two SCr measurements is 10 days, while the same for PCR is 14 days.

In the cohort, 44 out of 239 patients observed graft failure (death-censored). The survival probability one year post transplantation is 97.87\%. The graft survival probabilities and 95\% CI estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimator are presented in Figure \ref{fig : km_curve}.
